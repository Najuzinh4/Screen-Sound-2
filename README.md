# Screen Sound 2

Welcome to "Screen Sound 2", the evolution of our previous project "Screen Sound". This is the second course in the Alura series, delving even deeper into C# development and the construction of an application inspired by music streaming services like Spotify.

## Overview
"Screen Sound 2" is a music application designed to provide an immersive and personalized listening experience for users. Developed with C# and advanced object-oriented programming concepts, the project is a natural continuation of our first course.

## What's New and Improved
- **Object-Oriented Architecture:** We've implemented a robust, object-oriented architecture to simplify code maintenance and expansion.

- **Class and Method Management:** We've introduced specialized classes and methods to handle different aspects of the application, resulting in more structured and efficient code.
